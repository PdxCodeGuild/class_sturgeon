# Lab 3: Blog

Let's make the template of a blog with a title, top-nav, side-nav, and multiple posts. Use [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) (header, nav, section, and footer). You can use a [custom font](https://fonts.google.com/), [fancy colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/), and make generate fake content using an [Ipsum](https://meettheipsums.com/).

Make sure you have a [responsive design](../docs/09%20-%20CSS%20Responsive%20Design.md) that offers different, legible layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. You can test this in the broswer devtools. Don't forget to use cascading min-width media queries for a mobile first design, and remember to include the responsive meta tag in your HTML.

It should look professional, but this does not mean it needs to be complicated. A clean, simple, minimalist layout with custom color pallate, fonts, and subtle backgrounds or whitespace works great. For examples of simple yet attractive design, check out:

## Suggested Steps:

1. Create the HTML structure for your blog, with all content included.
2. Create your mobile version, using the styling of your choice.
3. Use ```min-width``` media queries to add a tablet layout using flexbox. Customize your styling as needed. You probably want your breakpoint between phone and tablet widths to be somewhere around 640-768px.
4. Finally, add your desktop layout. Customize styling as needed. A good breakpoint for desktop screen sizes is around 960-1100px.
