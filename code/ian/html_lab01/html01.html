        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
        <p>"Stuntman" Mike McKay <i>(portrayed by Kurt Russel in Death Proof)</i> is first and formeost a stuntman, if it wasnt a cornerstone of his identity, he wouldn't include it in his name. 
            He spends most of his time on the road, driving fast and never looking back. A few of Mike's favorite things are cars, 
            stunts, and movies like Vanishing Point or Cannonball Run. Mike lives for the thrill, and his skull adorned, roll cage equipped, 1970 Chevy Nova
            reflects that. What he lacks in self awareness or regard for others, he more than makes up for in speeding tickets and active warrants. </p>
