            <h1>Alex Trebek</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Who is Alex Trebek? He was a Canadian-American game show host and television personality born July 22, 1940, who passed away on November 8, 2020 from a battle with pancreatic cancer. Trebek was best know for being the host of Jeopardy! (a syndicated general knowledge quiz show) for 37 seasons from 1984 until his death in 2020. He shocked the world in 2001 when he appeared without his mustache for the year's first season. Alex apparently chose to shave it off "on a whim", which made his son cry over the loss of his signature mustache. His mustache did make a brief reappearance in season 35. Alex started the season off with a full beard, but the next day he had shaved it down to a goatee. After that they asked fans to vote "to beard, or not to beard". The beard won out in an overwhelmingly majority, however, on September 20, 2018, Trebek was clean shaven again. He explained, "Sorry to have to tell you folks, but voting is now closed and we've determined that the winner - is my wife, Jean. She voted for me to be clean-shaven and so - that's it."</p>
