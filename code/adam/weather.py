#I saw an article about a landlord monitoring the router for traffic to spy on a female tennant. I'm not sure how to counter that professionally, but I figure a program that randomly does things interacting with the internet might be a good start. So here we are.
#Need to pip install BeatifulSoup
#Need to pip install pyautogui
#Need to pip install tkinter
#ending with smart-alick 8 ball to both let you know the traffic generator is done and to give you an answer as to what this program is doing besides the router spamming
