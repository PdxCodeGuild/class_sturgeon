You will need to install some things to get this to work
pip install pywin32, pyttsx3, tkinter, BeautifulSoup, pyautogui
and the file downloaded from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio 
    called PyAudio-0.2.11-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl for my version 3.9 python.
    I went to windows folder, typed cmd up in the path line on the top and it brought up a prompt for the folder, nice litle shortcut. From there
    pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl   which is the name of the downloaded file

If you try to pip install pyaudio, you'll run into errors. If you try to install that file without downloading it or getting it from this folder, again, errors.
This file is necessary for the text to voice features in the game.
