#The goal is to calculate how many years it will take for two jackalopes to create a population of 1000.
jackalopes = [0,0]
pop = len(jackalopes)

#Jackalopes are reproductive from ages 4-8 and die at age 10.
while pop < 1000:
    for each in jackalopes: 
        
    
    




#Gestation is instantaneous. Each gestation produces two offspring.


#Jackalopes are hermaphrodites, it takes a pair to reproduce, but any pair will do


#With these conditions in mind, we can represent our population as a list of ints.
